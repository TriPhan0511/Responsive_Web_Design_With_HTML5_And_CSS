    <!-- Providing alternate media source -->
    <!-- 
      The <source> tag enables us to provide alternate sources for media. For example,
      alongside providing an MP4 version of a video, if we wanted to provide support
      for a new format, we could easily do so. Furthermore, if the user didn't have any
      suitable playback technology in the browser, we could provide download links to
      the files themselves. Here's an example:
     -->

    <!-- 
      <video width="640" height="480" controls preload="auto" loop poster="myVideoPoster.png">
      <source src="myVideo.sp8" type="video/super8" />
      <source src="myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      <p><b>Download Video: </b>Mp4 Format: <a href="myVideo.mp4">MP4</a></p>
    </video>
     -->

    <!-- 
       In that case, we first specified the source of a made-up video format called super8.
       The browser goes top to bottom deciding waht to play, so if it doesn't support
       super8, it moves on to the next source, mp4 in this case. And on and on it goes,
       moving down to the download link if it can;t reconcile any of the source listed.
       The type attribute tells the browser the MIME type of the resource. If you fail to
       specify this, the browser will fetch the content and try to play it anyway. But if
       you know the MIME type, you should add it in the type attribute
      -->

    <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <!-- Audio and video tags work alomost identically -->
    <!-- 
      The <audio> tag works on the same principle as the <video> tag, with the same
      attributes (excluding width, height, and poster). The main difference between 
      the two is the fact that <audio> has no playback area for visible content.
